**Droid_Alligator-1.0** is a bash script for android exploration, built to help you assess the security posture of your android mobile applications, without needing a jailbreak. More specifically it does the following thinks:

1. Decode/unzip the apk and dump info such as passwords,  permissions and URLs.
2. Build/encode the apk from the folder supplied.
3. Sign the target android application using your keystore apk (you have to rename your keystore file to alligator_Keystore.ks).
